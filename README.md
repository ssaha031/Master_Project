Cancer detection using Linear Discriminant Analysis, 4 years prior to its onset.
An effective screening test must show asymptomatic cancer detection years before traditional diagnosis to reduce cancer mortality. There is frequently no effective treatment for cancer in its late stages. As the tumor can be surgically removed or treated with gentler drug regimens, survival rates rise significantly when cancer is discovered in its early stages; the average 5-year survival at an early stage is 91%, while the average 5-year survival at a late stage is 26%4. Therefore, the most crucial factor in the treatment of cancer is the early detection of tumors. Apart from the conventional detection tests performed in order to know if a particular patient has cancer, a non-invasive blood test has been devised known as the PanSeer blood test, which can be performed on the plasma samples collected from the patients and then we implemented a Machine learning algorithm namely Linear Discriminant Analysis to study if the patient has the cancer cell growth in it and will be diagnosed helps detect if a patient will be diagnosed with cancer, before 4-5 years.
